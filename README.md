Algorithms from "[Practical Astronomy with your Calculator or Spreadsheet](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Astronomy-your-Calculator-Spreadsheet/dp/1108436072)" by Peter Duffett-Smith.  API documentation is published [here](https://jfcarr-astronomy.github.io/practical-astronomy/).

If you're interested in this topic, please buy the book!  It provides far more detail and context.

## Roadmap

### Current State

All spreadsheets and macros from the book, implemented in:

- [x] **Python 3**  (See details in python-implementation/lib/README.md)  The only Python 3 dependency is [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [x] **Rust** (See details in rust-implementation/README.md)

### Future

- [ ] Build a more comprehensive suite of unit tests.
