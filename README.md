Algorithms from "[Practical Astronomy with your Calculator or Spreadsheet](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Astronomy-your-Calculator-Spreadsheet/dp/1108436072)" by Peter Duffett-Smith.  API documentation is published [here](https://jfcarr-astronomy.github.io/practical-astronomy/).

If you're interested in this topic, please buy the book!  It provides far more detail and context.

## Done

All spreadsheets and macros from the book, implemented in Python 3.  (See details in lib/README.md)

The only Python 3 dependency is [Numpy](https://numpy.org/).

## Roadmap

The Python 3 implementation is intended as a learning tool.  The code is easier to read and understand, but won't hold up as well where speed is required.  So, the next step will be re-implementing the Python code in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).  You can follow that work in the [rust-implementation branch](https://github.com/jfcarr-astronomy/practical-astronomy/tree/rust-implementation/rust-implementation).
